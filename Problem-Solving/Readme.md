# Problem Solving

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to write the specific code to implement the solution. At its core, problem-solving focuses on the study, understanding, and usage of data structures and algorithms.

At HackerRank, this competency area includes:
- Basic Level. Basic Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Intermediate level. 
    - usage of HashMaps, stacks, queues, heaps, and analyzing run-time complexities and space complexities, use optimal solutions to solve problems, among others.

# Problem Solving

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to write the specific code to implement the solution. At its core, problem-solving focuses on the study, understanding, and usage of data structures and algorithms.

At HackerRank, this competency area includes:
- **Basic Level.**
    - Data Structures. Arrays and Strings. Traverse through arrays, strings, and linked lists. Access and update individual elements in arrays, and characters in strings.
    - Algorithms: Create simple sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, counting sort. Create simple brute force and sub-optimal solutions.

- **Intermediate level.** 
    - Data Structures. HashMaps, stacks, queues, heaps. Manipulate single or double linked lists.
    - Algorithms: Optimal solutions to solve problems. Analyze run-time complexities and space complexities. Create simple dynamic programming-based algorithms.

- **Advance level.** 
    - Data Structures. Trees, Graph Traversal. Find the shortest paths, diameter, etc. Use trees such as binary search effectively.
    - Algorithms: Dynamic Programming and Specialized Algorithms. Knowledge of efficient string search algorithms such as Rabin-Karp and Knuth-Morris-Pratt. Efficient graph search algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Create complex or multi-dimensional dynamic programming models.

In this repository, you will find basic, intermediate and advance exercises.

# Problem Solving

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to write the specific code to implement the solution. At its core, problem-solving focuses on the study, understanding, and usage of data structures and algorithms.

At HackerRank, this competency area includes:
- *Basic Level*.
    - Data Structures. HashMaps, stacks, queues, heaps. Manipulate single or double linked lists.
    - Algorithms: Optimal solutions to solve problems. Analyze run-time complexities and space complexities. Create simple dynamic programming-based algorithms.

- Intermediate level. 
    - Data Structures. HashMaps, stacks, queues, heaps. Manipulate single or double linked lists.
    - Algorithms: Optimal solutions to solve problems. Analyze run-time complexities and space complexities. Create simple dynamic programming-based algorithms.

# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is the buzzword these days. We’ve seen cases where **Chess champions were defeated by computers** but we’ve also noticed computers struggling to win against the masters of **GO**.

HackerRank, has a bunch of CodeChallenges that specifically test AI programming skills. All of these are an awesome way to learn, which is becoming an ever-present part of the STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Math) community.

Here, you can find a detailed explanation of my optimal solutions to challenges related to statistics and machine learning.

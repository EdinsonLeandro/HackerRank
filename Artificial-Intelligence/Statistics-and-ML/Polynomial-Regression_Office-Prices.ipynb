    "## Problem\n",
    "Charlie wants to purchase office-space. He does a detailed survey of the offices and corporate complexes in the area, and tries to quantify a lot of factors, such as the distance of the offices from residential and other commercial areas, schools and workplaces; the reputation of the construction companies and builders involved in constructing the apartments; the distance of the offices from highways, freeways and important roads; the facilities around the office space and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these factors are quantified, normalized and mapped to values on a scale of 0 to 1. Charlie then makes a table. Each row in the table corresponds to Charlie's observations for a particular house. If Charlie has observed and noted F features, the row contains F values separated by a single space, followed by the office-space price in dollars/square-foot. If Charlie makes observations for H houses, his observation table has (F+1) columns and H rows, and a total of (F+1) * H entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charlie does several such surveys and provides you with the tabulated data. At the end of these tables are some rows which have just F columns (the price per square foot is missing). Your task is to predict these prices. F can be any integer number between 1 and 5, both inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important observation which Charlie has made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prices per square foot, are (approximately) a polynomial function of the features in the observation table. This polynomial always has an order less than 4\n",

    "The first line contains two space separated integers, F and N. Over here, F is the number of observed features. N is the number of rows for which features as well as price per square-foot have been noted.\n",
    "This is followed by a table having F+1 columns and N rows with each row in a new line and each column separated by a single space. The last column is the price per square foot.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Polynomial regression</b> is a special case of linear regression, by the fact that we create some polynomial features before creating a linear regression. This approach is need it here because the prices per square foot are a polynomial function of the features with an order greater than or equal to 1 and less than 4.\n",

# Project Euler

**What is Project Euler?**

According to Project Euler [website](https://projecteuler.net/), it is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

**Can anyone solve the problems?**

The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.

**HackerRank**

HackerRank provides an environment for solving these challenges. Here's a [list](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) of the challenges available in HackerRank. In this repository you will find my solutions.

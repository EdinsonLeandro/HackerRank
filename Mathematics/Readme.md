# Mathematics

Mathematics is very important in programming and computer science in general. Mathematical calculations are an essential part of most Python development. Whether you’re working on a scientific project, a financial application, or any other type of programming endeavor, you just can’t escape the need for math. Therefore, in this repository you will find math exercises and my proposed solutions.

HackeRank has the following subdomains to practice maths:
- Fundamentals.
- Number Theory.
- Combinatorics.
- Algebra.
- Geometry.
- Probability.
- Linear Algebra Foundations.

In the following sections, you will find solved exercises of each subdomains.
